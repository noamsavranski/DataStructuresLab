# DynamicDataStructures

A Java implementation of custom dynamic data structures including:

MyAVLTree – A self-balancing binary search tree (AVL Tree)
MyLinkedList – A doubly linked list with support for efficient insertion and deletion
MyFirstDataStructure – A composite data structure using both AVL Tree and Linked List
MyDynamicSet – A dynamic set implementation that supports fast successor and predecessor queries
Element, ListLink, ArrayElement – Element types used across the structures to store key-data pairs

Features

✅ Insertion and deletion in custom data structures
✅ Search, minimum, maximum, successor and predecessor queries
✅ Correct linkage and order maintenance using ListLink references
✅ AVL Tree balancing for efficient operations
